I will describe the Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP) Framework as described in the classic PDP book by Rumelhart and Mclelland.

The parts of a network:
-A *set of processing units*
-A *state of activation*
-An *output function* for each unit
-A *pattern of connectivity* among units
-A *propagation rule* for propagating patterns of activities through the network of connectivities
-An *activation rule* for combining the inputs impinging on a unit with the current state of that unit to produce a new level of activation for the unit
-A *learning rule* whereby patterns of connectivity are modified by experience
-An *envirnoment* within which the system must operate.

When creating a network, it is important to define these aspects of the model. 
This should be relatively exhaustive, but if it might be necessary/useful to include other aspects, go ahead and define them as well.

As I finished writing this, I found a pdf of chapter 2 of the referenced book. Feel free to skim/read:
